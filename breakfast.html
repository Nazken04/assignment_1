            <h3>Scrambled Eggs</h3>
            <img src="scrambled.jpg" alt="Scrambled Eggs">
            <hr>
            <p><strong>A simple and delicious breakfast dish made with eggs, butter, and seasoning.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just 
                    <br />one consistency.</li>
                <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Don’t allow the butter to brown or <br /> it will discolour the eggs.</li>
                <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the <br /> bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>
                <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
                <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Pancakes</h3>
            <img src="pancakes.jpg" alt="Pancakes">
            <hr>
            <p> <strong> American pancakes topped with maple syrup and fresh berries. </strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix 200g self-raising flour, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Create a well in the centre with the back of your spoon then add 3 large eggs, 25g melted butter and 200ml milk.</li>
                <li>Whisk together either with a balloon whisk or electric hand beaters until smooth then pour into a jug.</li>
                <li>Heat a small knob of butter and 1 tsp of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. When <br />
                     butter looks frothy, pour in rounds of the batter, approximately 8cm wide. Make sure you don’t put the pancakes <br /> 
                     too close together as they will spread during cooking. Cook the pancakes on one side for about 1-2 mins or until <br />
                     lots of tiny bubbles start to appear and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for a further minute <br />
                     on the other side. Repeat until all the batter is used up.</li>
                <li>Serve your pancakes stacked up on a plate with a drizzle of maple syrup and any of your favourite toppings.</li>
