            <h3>Spaghetti Bolognese</h3>
            <img src="bolognese.jpg" alt="Spaghetti Bolognese">
            <hr>
            <p><strong> Classic spaghetti bolognese with ground beef and tomato sauce.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Put 1 tbsp of the oil in a large saucepan over a medium-high heat, add the beef and fry until well browned. <br />
                    Tip out into a dish and repeat with 1 tbsp oil and the pork. Tip the pork into the dish with the beef and put <br />
                    the pan back on the heat with the remaining oil. Turn the heat down and cook the shallots for 8-10 mins or until <br />
                    very soft, then add the garlic. Tip the meat back into the pan and add the passata, purée, wine and oregano. <br />
                    Stir everything together, cover and simmer over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 45 mins.</li>
                <li>Cook the spaghetti following pack instructions, then stir half the parmesan into the Bolognese. Put a spoonful <br />
                    of the pasta water into the sauce to loosen it if it looks too thick, then drain the spaghetti. For a better <br />
                    flavour, tip the pasta onto the sauce, toss everything together to coat, and season well (or serve with the <br />
                    sauce on top). Add the remaining parmesan and a few basil leaves.</li>
              </ol>

            <h3>Grilled Salmon</h3>
            <img src="salmon.jpg" alt="Grilled Salmon">
            <hr>
            <p><strong> A salmon fillet served with lemon and dill sauce.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turn the grill to high and line a baking tray with foil. Mix the lemon zest and juice, mustard and honey. <br />
                    Put the salmon on the tray, brush with a little of the dressing, then grill for 5-7 mins – there is no need <br />
                    to turn the salmon over until it flakes easily when tested with a knife.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wok and cook the spring onions and beetroot. Tip in the lentils with 4 tbsp <br />
                    water, cover the pan and cook for 2 mins to heat through. Tip into a bowl and toss with the remaining dressing, <br />
                    the basil and rocket. Serve with the salmon.</li>
