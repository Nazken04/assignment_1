            <h3>Chicken Salad</h3>
            <img src="chicken.jpg" alt="Chicken Salad">
            <hr>
            <p><strong> A healthy chicken salad with mixed greens, grilled chicken, and vinaigrette dressing.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, <br />
                    cumin, garlic and honey. Mix well. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets in total, <br />
                    then add to the marinade and mix well to coat. Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow <br />
                    the flavours to penetrate the chicken. </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, mix the peanut butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1 tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce. <br />
                    When ready to cook the chicken, wipe a large non-stick frying pan with a little oil. Add the chicken and cook, <br />
                    covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a medium heat, turning the fillets over for the last min, until cooked but <br />
                    still moist. Set aside, covered, to rest for a few mins.</li>
                <li>While the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, shallot, coriander and pomegranate, and pile <br />
                    onto plates. Spoon over a little sauce. Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce. <br />
                    Eat while the chicken is still warm.</li>
              </ol>

            <h3>Veggie Wrap</h3>
            <img src="veggie.jpg" alt="Veggie Wrap">
            <hr>
            <p><strong> A delicious veggie wrap filled with fresh vegetables and hummus.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix all the ingredients except for the tortilla and toss well.</li>
                <li>Put the tortilla on a sheet of foil and pile the filling along one side of the wrap â€“ it will almost look <br />
                    like too much mixture, but once you start to roll it firmly it will compact. Roll the tortilla from the filling <br />
                    side, folding in the sides as you go. Fold the foil in at the ends to keep stuff inside the wrap. Cut in half and <br />
                    eat straight away. If taking to work, leave whole and wrap up like a cracker in baking parchment.</li>
              </ol>
